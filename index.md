## Project Description
The goal of the project was to build a song recommender using Spotify API sound features, KMeans clustering and web scraping with Beautiful Soup.
The user inputs a song's title and then the script returns a new song which matches it's acoustic characteristics.

## Hypotheses / Questions
* How to make use of algorithms to cluster songs based on acoustic data?
* How to compare and match a particular song with others?

## Dataset
* The data was obtained by scraping with Beautiful Soup and by using the Spotify API to fetch thousands of songs from the Spotify playlists.

## Cleaning
* Some cleaning required as not all the songs have complete feature information.
* Also several duplicates due to the nature of playlists.

## Analysis

## Model Training and Evaluation

## Conclusion
* I was able to generate recommendations based on the selected features.
* The number of clusters selected could be higher. More data or features probably needed.

## Future Work
* The project could be upscaled and refined. The features may not be all relevant.
* Implementing an interface could be interesting.
